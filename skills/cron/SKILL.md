# Cron-Claude Skill

Automated task scheduling and execution for Claude via Windows Task Scheduler.

## Overview

Cron-Claude enables you to schedule Claude to perform tasks automatically on recurring schedules. Tasks are defined in markdown files and executed via Windows Task Scheduler.

## Features

- 🕐 Schedule tasks with cron expressions
- 🔐 Cryptographic audit logging with HMAC signatures
- 💾 Logs stored via memory integration
- 🔔 Optional Windows toast notifications
- 🎯 CLI or API execution modes
- 🛡️ Native Windows Task Scheduler integration

## Quick Start

### Create a Task

```
Create a cron task called "daily-report" that runs every day at 9 AM.
The task should generate a daily summary.
```

### Register with Scheduler

```
Register my daily-report task with Windows Task Scheduler
```

### View Tasks

```
Show me all my scheduled cron tasks
```

### Run Immediately

```
Run my daily-report task right now for testing
```

## Task Definition

Tasks are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: my-task
schedule: "0 9 * * *"  # Daily at 9 AM
invocation: cli         # 'cli' or 'api'
notifications:
  toast: true
enabled: true
---

## Cron Schedule Format

```
 ┌─── minute (0-59)
 │ ┌─── hour (0-23)
 │ │ ┌─── day of month (1-31)
 │ │ │ ┌─── month (1-12)
 │ │ │ │ ┌─── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
 * * * * *
```

### Common Examples

- `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9 AM
- `0 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours
- `30 8 * * 1-5` - 8:30 AM on weekdays
- `0 0 * * 0` - Midnight every Sunday
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes

## Invocation Methods

**CLI Mode** (`invocation: cli`)
- Uses local `claude-code` command
- Full Claude environment with all tools
- Best for complex, interactive tasks
- Requires Claude CLI installed

**API Mode** (`invocation: api`)
- Direct Anthropic API calls
- More reliable for simple tasks
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- May incur API costs

## Available MCP Tools

- **cron_create_task** - Create a new scheduled task
- **cron_register_task** - Register with Task Scheduler
- **cron_unregister_task** - Remove from scheduler
- **cron_enable_task** - Enable a task
- **cron_disable_task** - Disable a task
- **cron_run_task** - Execute immediately
- **cron_list_tasks** - Show all tasks
- **cron_get_task** - Get task definition
- **cron_view_logs** - View execution logs
- **cron_verify_log** - Verify log signatures
- **cron_status** - System status

## Audit Logging

Every task execution is automatically logged with:
- ✅ All actions and steps taken
- ✅ Outputs and errors
- ✅ Timestamps
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature for verification

Logs are stored via the memory integration and can be verified for authenticity.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Claude Code with MCP support
- Claude CLI (for CLI mode)
- Anthropic API Key (for API mode)

## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Executing

Check task status:
```
Check the status of my [task-id] task
```

Verify it's:
- Registered with Task Scheduler
- Enabled in both file and scheduler
- Has a valid schedule

### No Notifications

- Check `notifications.toast: true` in task file
- Verify Windows notification settings
- Disable Focus Assist temporarily

### Logs Not Appearing

- Verify memory integration is working
- Check fallback `./logs/` directory

## Examples

### Daily Summary Task

```
Create a task that runs every morning at 8 AM to:
1. Check my calendar for today's events
2. Generate a summary report
3. Send a notification when complete
```

### Weekly Backup Task

```
Create a task that runs every Sunday at midnight to:
1. Archive important project files
2. Store metadata about the backup
3. Verify the backup completed successfully
```

### Hourly Monitor Task

```
Create a task that runs every hour to:
1. Check system health
2. Log any issues
3. Alert if problems detected
```
