**Automated task scheduling for Claude via Windows Task Scheduler.** This MCP server enables Claude to execute tasks automatically on recurring schedules—perfect for daily reports, backups, monitoring, and more.

## 🚀 Installation

### Claude Code (Recommended)

**One command to install:**

```bash
claude plugin add @patrick-rodgers/cron-claude
```

**That's it!** The plugin installs automatically with:
- ✅ Session hooks (shows available commands on startup)
- ✅ Slash commands (`/cron-status`, `/cron-list`, `/cron-run`)
- ✅ All 11 task management tools
- ✅ No configuration needed

### Claude Desktop

**Add to your MCP configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cron-claude": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@patrick-rodgers/cron-claude"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Config file location:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Restart Claude Desktop after adding the configuration.

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** - Uses Windows Task Scheduler
- **Node.js 18+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Claude CLI** (optional) - For CLI invocation mode
- **Anthropic API Key** (optional) - For API invocation mode

## ✨ Features

- 🕐 **Cron Scheduling** - Use familiar cron expressions for flexible scheduling
- 🛡️ **Windows Task Scheduler** - Reliable, native scheduling that survives reboots
- 🔐 **Audit Logging** - HMAC-SHA256 signatures for tamper-proof logs
- 💾 **Simple File Storage** - Tasks and logs stored as markdown files (easy to backup)
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications** - Optional Windows notifications on completion
- 🎯 **Flexible Execution** - Run via Claude CLI or Anthropic API
- 🔌 **Full MCP Integration** - Works seamlessly in all Claude Code sessions
- 📁 **Configurable Directories** - Store tasks and logs wherever you want

## 📚 How It Works

### Task Definition

Tasks are defined in markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: daily-summary
schedule: "0 9 * * *"  # Every day at 9 AM
invocation: cli         # 'cli' or 'api'
notifications:
  toast: true
enabled: true
---

# Daily Summary Task

Generate a summary of:
1. Today's calendar events
2. Open tasks and priorities
3. Recent updates

Format as a concise report and save to memory.
```

### Storage

**Default locations** (configurable via `~/.cron-claude/config.json`):

```
~/.cron-claude/
├── config.json              # Configuration
├── tasks/                   # Task definitions
│   ├── daily-summary.md
│   ├── weekly-backup.md
│   └── hourly-monitor.md
└── logs/                    # Execution logs (HMAC signed)
    ├── daily-summary_2024-02-17T09-00-00_exec-123.md
    └── weekly-backup_2024-02-17T18-00-00_exec-456.md
```

**Why file-based?**
- ✅ Simple and reliable - no external dependencies
- ✅ Easy to backup (point directories to OneDrive/Dropbox)
- ✅ Version control friendly (Git)
- ✅ Easy to inspect and debug
- ✅ Works offline

### Execution Flow

1. **Schedule** → Windows Task Scheduler triggers at scheduled time
2. **Execute** → Task runs via Claude CLI or Anthropic API
3. **Log** → Execution results written to `~/.cron-claude/logs/` with HMAC signature
4. **Notify** → Optional toast notification on completion

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Create and Schedule a Task

**You:**
```
Create a cron task that runs every Monday at 9 AM to generate a weekly report.
Use the CLI invocation method and enable toast notifications.
```

**Claude will:**
1. Use `cron_create_task` to create the task file
2. Ask you to review the task definition
3. Use `cron_register_task` to schedule it with Task Scheduler

### Check Task Status

**You:**
```
What cron tasks do I have and when will they run next?
```

**Claude will:**
1. Use `cron_list_tasks` to show all tasks
2. Display schedule, status, and next run times

### Run a Task Immediately

**You:**
```
Run my daily-summary task right now for testing
```

**Claude will:**
1. Use `cron_run_task` to execute immediately
2. Use `cron_view_logs` to show the results

### Verify Logs

**You:**
```
Verify the integrity of the logs for my backup task
```

**Claude will:**
1. Use `cron_view_logs` to retrieve logs
2. Use `cron_verify_log` to check HMAC signatures
3. Report if logs are authentic and unmodified

## 📋 Cron Schedule Format

```
 ┌─── minute (0-59)
 │ ┌─── hour (0-23)
 │ │ ┌─── day of month (1-31)
 │ │ │ ┌─── month (1-12)
 │ │ │ │ ┌─── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
 * * * * *
```

**Common Examples:**
- `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9 AM
- `0 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours
- `30 8 * * 1-5` - 8:30 AM on weekdays (Monday-Friday)
- `0 0 * * 0` - Midnight every Sunday
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
- `0 12 1 * *` - Noon on the 1st of every month

## 🎯 Invocation Methods

### CLI Mode (`invocation: cli`)

- Uses local `claude-code` command
- Full Claude environment with all tools
- Best for complex, interactive tasks
- Requires Claude CLI installed

**Example use cases:**
- Tasks requiring file operations
- Tasks using other MCP tools
- Complex multi-step workflows

### API Mode (`invocation: api`)

- Direct Anthropic API calls
- More reliable for simple tasks
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- May incur API costs

**Example use cases:**
- Simple status checks
- Notifications and alerts
- Lightweight monitoring tasks

## 🔒 Audit Logging & Security

### Automatic Logging

Every task execution is automatically logged with:
- ✅ All actions and steps taken
- ✅ Outputs and errors
- ✅ Timestamps for each operation
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signature

**Logs are stored as markdown files** in `~/.cron-claude/logs/` with filenames like:
```
{task-id}_{timestamp}_{execution-id}.md
```

This makes them:
- Easy to search and review
- Simple to backup (copy directory to OneDrive/Dropbox)
- Compatible with version control
- Verifiable against tampering

### Log Verification

Ask Claude to verify any log:
```
Verify the logs for task [task-id] haven't been tampered with
```

Claude will check the HMAC signature to ensure authenticity.

### Secret Key

On first use, Cron-Claude generates a secret key:
- Stored in: `~/.cron-claude/config.json`
- Used for: Signing all log entries with HMAC-SHA256
- Keep secure: Treat like a password

### Configurable Storage

You can configure where tasks and logs are stored:

```json
{
  "secretKey": "auto-generated",
  "tasksDir": "C:\\Users\\you\\OneDrive\\cron-tasks",
  "logsDir": "C:\\Users\\you\\OneDrive\\cron-logs"
}
```

This allows you to:
- Backup tasks and logs to cloud storage
- Share task definitions across machines
- Use version control (Git) for task definitions
- Organize logs however you prefer

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Available

1. Check if registered:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/config.json
   ```

2. Look for `cron-claude` in `mcpServers`

3. Reinstall plugin:
   ```bash
   claude plugin add @patrick-rodgers/cron-claude
   ```

4. Restart Claude Code

### Task Not Executing on Schedule

Ask Claude:
```
Check the status of my [task-id] cron task
```

Claude will:
1. Check if task is registered
2. Verify it's enabled
3. Show next scheduled run time

You can also check Windows Task Scheduler manually:
- Open Task Scheduler
- Look for tasks named `CronClaude_[task-id]`

### No Toast Notifications

- Verify `notifications.toast: true` in task file
- Check Windows notification settings
- Disable "Focus Assist" temporarily

### Logs Not Appearing

- Check configured log directory in `~/.cron-claude/config.json`
- Verify directory has write permissions
- Check disk space availability
- Look in default location: `~/.cron-claude/logs/`
